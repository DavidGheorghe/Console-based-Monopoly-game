# Console-based-Monopoly-game
The game is console-based. It can be played by 2-4 players. The option to trade with others players is not possible. Also, the "Community Chest" and "Chance" cards are not available yet. The games starts with number of players. After that, each player chooses his color: Red, Green, Blue or Brown, and "throw" a dice. Two numbers between 1 and 6 are randomly generated. The players are orderd based on that dice. The player with the highest dice will be first and so on. The game ends when all the others players, except for one, go bankrupt(i.e. has no property and money). All players are placed on "START" space in the begging. Each player goes forward the number of dice. If the dice is a double then the player throw again. At 3 consecutive doubles he goes to jail. If the space is a property and it is available then the player has the option to buy it. If the property is not available that means antoher player owns it and the current player must pay rent. In order to finish the game faster because trades are not possible, the rent is 10 times more than usual. Exceptions are the stations and the utilites properties, where the rent is same as in game. When a player goes to jail the rules are the same.
I created this game to improve my skills in Java and learn OOPs principles.
